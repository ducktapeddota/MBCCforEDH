# MBCCforEDH
my first project, just estimates a land base cost for edh decks
notes:
this is the first sort of project that ive done outside of of school assignments

I started this out of some free time

this is basically just practice and review of the concepts covered in class

im aware alot of the code has better ways to do it but this was everything off the top of my head

got alot of things to do but some of the //comments are obsolete :C

all values are just estimations

the basic workings of the program should allow for me to change to more optimal code but thats just a matter of time

functionality is going to be expanded upon over time

probably overhaul the inner workings before proceeding
